# Password-Generator

## Your Task

For this week's challenge we were given the task to help, people create a password generator so you won't have to come up with one. The password generator helps create a password at random for the user. It ask the user a couple questions based upon the type of password the user wants. It asks if you want upper or lower case letters, including if you want numbers or special characters. An alert window will pop up and you'll have to confirm yes or no based on the user's needs
